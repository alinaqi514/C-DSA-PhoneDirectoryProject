# C-DSA-PhoneDirectoryProjectIn this project, work was divided into phase 1 and phase 2 respectively. PHASE 1 :- a stack using an array was implemented with using a linked list. Some functions implemented in stack are push(item), pop(), peek(), show(stk), push(item) and pop(). The elements basically will be pushed, popped from the stack whereas peek() will return topmost stack element and the function show(stk) will show all the entered data in the stack. Another problem statement in phase 1, a queue using array and linked list was also implemented. Some of the functions used are enqueue(item), dequeue(q), peek(q), show(q), enqueue(element) and dequeue(q). These add elements at front and removed elements from the rear point of a queue. peek(q) returns the front of the queue without removing the element and show(q) displays data in queue. In phase 2, a phone directory has been implemented using BST where it will lookup all data stored in a .txt file In ‘name mobile email’ format. In this we can search directory for name and it will print the respective details, using Display() it lists out entire directory, Display_first() which displays the details of first record in directory and Display_last() which displays the details of last directory
